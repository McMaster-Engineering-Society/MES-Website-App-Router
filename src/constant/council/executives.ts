My goals are to revitalize the spirit and image of the MES for everyone involved. Whether its professional development, investing in our future, or just building up the legacy of MacEng. I plan for a more cohesive and engaged team to give us the best experience possible. Book a meeting with me! https://calendar.app.google/QzW93DuRjtdpUmqP7",

TLDR, I'm the nerd with the spreadsheets that plays with numbers (about 1 million this year :o), and everything that goes along with that! Essentially, making sure MES doesn't go up in flames. When I'm not playing with money, I'm hanging out with my cat, singing, sewing, or vibing in the office; so if you see me please don't be a stranger (and come see photos of my cat!) ☺️",
