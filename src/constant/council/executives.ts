      'Hello! My name is Alexis and it is an absolute honour to serve as your MES President this year! My job is to create the vision for this organization and ensure our team of 100+ students is set up for success in accomplishing their goals and duties. My priorities for this year include fostering unity within the MES and the greater community, serving our clubs more effectively, championing integrity in our decision-making and accountability, and allowing individual ideas to thrive in the society - you donâ€™t need to be the president to make an impact :) I am so excited to lead this exceptionally talented team and make this a year to remember!',
