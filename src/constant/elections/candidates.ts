    programLevel: 'iBioMed, Level 1',
    introduction: `My name is Brandon Yoo and I am an aspiring IBEHS student from Oakville. Alongside my studies, I am a dancer training in various styles. To this role, I bring a strong sense of teamwork and leadership. In my time as a dancer I have constantly worked in team settings. Throughout these experiences, I have gained first-hand knowledge for working with a high-level team. Time-management, communication, and hard-work are just a handful of the necessary skills that my team needed to work together to become successful. Despite facing challenges, we were able to reach various awards and opportunities that can be credited to each other because of our teamwork. My skills in leadership can also be accredited to my time as a dancer. Within the past couple years, I’ve begun to choreograph and teach for other studios. This meant that I had to learn how to properly lead a group effectively while maintaining a positive atmosphere, resulting in me building necessary skills as a leader such as adaptability and patience. Not all groups are willing to be lead from the start, but with proper treatment and attitude, success can be fostered for anyone.`,
    platform: `I've seen many campaigns for these types of roles, and I always see that they are accompanied by specific promises or goals such as merchandise, events, etc. But I see this role differently. I won’t start off with attempting to get new items or make big changes. Instead, I will start off with something so simple and obvious it seems silly: I want to open a consistent and effective line of communication between me and those who I am representing. It is my greatest held philosophy that communication is the first and most important part of any actionable idea, solution, innovation, etc. Effective communication is all about learning and considering all available knowledge and opinions in the related groups involved in a situation. If communication is not prioritized, then plans are more likely to fail or be misunderstood. This role, iBiomed Rep, is primarily meant to be a gateway for communication between iBiomed first years and the McMaster Engineering Society. So instead of trying to come up with revolutionary ideas that I think everyone will love, I will open the lines of communication to discover what people actually want. Only then, will I act for something new, something changed, and/or something removed. Of course, this line of communication can’t be a guarantee to everyone getting exactly what they want. It will be, however, a guarantee that everyone will be heard, and that everyone’s ideas and opinions will be considered. Being iBiomed Rep isn’t just about hearing what all the first years have to say though; it is also about communicating the plans and events of the McMaster Engineering Society to all of my fellow iBiomed first years. So this line of communication will also bring the first years the information and ideas of the McMaster Engineering Society. This means that instead of potentially making a change or starting the planning of an event, the ideas will first be brought to the iBiomed first years to gain their opinions on the matter. But how will I build this effective line of communication? I believe that the most important aspect of effective communication is that it is easy. If communication is not first made easy and accessible, then it can never be effective. This means not waiting for the first years to bring me their ideas and opinions, but instead bringing them the opportunities to relay those thoughts. This could mean allocating time during IBEHS lectures for people to talk to me, sending emails for inquiry from the students, and having an open and always accessible inbox to all iBiomed first years. I will make it easy to reach me by facilitating and opening the lines of communication myself so that the first years do not have to ponder if they are heard.`,

    introduction: `Hey there! My name is Agnes Kung, and I am a first-year iBioMed student. During my exploration of all the clubs and fascinating opportunities at McMaster, I consistently found myself drawn to the students who served as representatives or the face of a particular club or group of people. Their passion, dedication, and optimistic personalities stood out to me as I saw these traits within myself.  

Furthermore, meeting and working with fellow iBioMed students enlightened me to the vibrant community within McMaster. During welcome week, the upper years would always highlight how unique and uplifting the engineering community is, but it wasn’t until my first two weeks here—between helpful conversations and late nights at Thode—that I truly appreciated the depth of that community. This sparked my desire to celebrate and stand with and for my program. I believe that with my many previous experiences of being a leader and executive in high school clubs, tied with my devoted personality, I could be a very helpful member to my iBioMed class and to the McMaster Engineering Society as well.`,
    platform: `If I were elected as the first-year iBioMed Representative of McMaster Engineering Society, my main goal would be to make sure every iBioMed student’s voice is heard loud and clear. Although our program may be small, our potential is huge, and I want to make sure none of us feel overshadowed. My mission is to help create an unforgettable year by fostering a strong sense of community and providing an opportunity for everyone to share their ideas and concerns. 

After talking to some other iBioMed students, a common concern that was brought up was that we wanted more iBioMed specific events that targeted our passion for biomedical innovation. This included workshops, potential guest speakers, or other events tailored to our interests. Whatever ideas the students want to bring, I am committed to bringing them to life. Together, we can create experiences that showcase the unique talents of the iBioMed community while celebrating the Faculty of Engineering!`,

    introduction: `Hey my name’s Mitchell and if it wasn’t obvious by the position I’m applying for, I’m in iBiomed! A few things about me is that I enjoy being active by rock climbing, running and pumping iron in the gym (working out lol). Studying in groups with my friends or meeting new people at the library is also one of my favorite ways to spend my time. In general, I love to spend time with people, new or not,  whether it’s over a meal or playing board games. Having had a passion for student leadership throughout high school, I bring a breadth of knowledge, experience, and passion to this position. Specifically, I was enrolled in the STEM+ program at my school and mentored incoming grade 9 students that were stepping foot into high school. Overall, I am a very outgoing person who enjoys meeting new people and planning events and activities that bring the community together!`,
    platform: `The MES plays a big role in shaping the university experience for engineers at Mac, making it crucial to have a strong team of executives that care about student success and the community within. As First Year iBiomed representative for MES, a couple things that I would implement are open communication systems, networking opportunities and interactive events. 

1. Open Communication Systems
I believe that our iBiomed representative should be a bridge between the MES and first year iBio students. As iBiomed rep., I know that I will be a reliable source of communication between the two groups and promise to effectively deliver announcements and updates to all first year iBio’s. I am an approachable person who has a genuine passion for student success and wellness and will go to great lengths to ensure that students feel heard and supported by the MES. I understand that some people may find it difficult to reach out in person which is why I would also set up an anonymous google feedback form where students can fill it out if they have anything they want to say. 

2. Networking Opportunities 
At its core, MES is a community of like-minded students looking to excel not only in the classroom but also interpersonally. Networking is an incredibly powerful tool that will help iBio students in the future; which is why I would introduce enhanced networking events where students can get to know one another and meet people in fields of their interests. Bringing back even more alumni from various engineering fields would give the students a glimpse into the workforce and what their potential futures would look like. Being such a small community, I will also set up group study sessions that could benefit students by giving the opportunity to work and meet new people at a more personal level compared to other social environments. 

3. Interactive Events
Despite our heavy course load, I believe that it’s important for students to have a good balance of academics and socialization! This includes more get togethers, not only with first years but all iBio students. This gives our year the opportunity to ask upper years any questions they may have. I would also like to introduce off-campus adventures whether that be hiking cohorts, jogging groups or exploring Hamilton with one another. This will allow students to get to know those in their cohorts better, developing a stronger and tight knit community.`,

Overall, I’m ready to put in the time and effort to make a positive impact and help us all have an awesome first year. I think this role is a great opportunity for me to do just that, and I’m excited for the chance to get involved!`,
    platform: `My platform as a first-year representative is all about making sure every student feels heard, included, and supported during our first year at McMaster. I think the transition to university can be challenging, especially when it comes to balancing academics with social life and getting involved in campus activities. My goal is to help make that transition as smooth as possible for all of us. One of the key things I want to focus on is improving communication between students and the Engineering Society. Sometimes, it can be hard to know what’s going on or who to turn to if you have questions or concerns. I want to make sure that every first-year student feels comfortable reaching out for help, whether that’s through more accessible online resources, creating dedicated channels for feedback, or holding regular check-ins where students can share their thoughts. It’s really important to me that everyone has a chance to voice their opinions and that those opinions are actually taken into account when decisions are made. Another thing I want to push for is more opportunities for first-year students to connect with each other and upper-year students. Networking and building friendships are a huge part of the university experience, and I think we can do more to encourage that. I would really love to organize more social events specifically for first-year students, so we can get to know each other better and build a strong sense of community from the start. In addition, creating mentorship opportunities with upper-year students could help us navigate the academic side of things and provide some guidance on getting involved in different clubs, teams, and societies. In terms of academics, I know that the workload can be overwhelming at times. I would also love to work with the Engineering Society to explore ways we can offer more peer-led study sessions or group learning opportunities, so we can support each other academically. This would not only help us stay on top of our studies but also encourage collaboration and make learning a more shared experience. Overall, my platform is focused on creating a more connected and supportive environment for all first-year students. I want to make sure we have the resources we need to succeed, both academically and socially, and that everyone feels like they belong here at McMaster. If I’m elected as first-year rep, I’ll work hard to make these ideas a reality and ensure that our voices are heard every step of the way.`,

    introduction: `As you know, I am a first year CS student looking to get involved in McMaster both educationally and recreationally. I have a background in student politics, serving as a student senator as a high school student, as well as advocating for the student body to the AMDSB school board. During that period of time, I spearheaded an initiative to raise awareness and organize the collection and proper disposal of E-Waste throughout the board. My goal as a first year is help others acclimate to CS and encourage congregation of CS students with Engineers to bring everyone together as a faculty while working to assist CS students with finding their place at Mac and beyond.`,
    platform: `As a Computer Science student, it can feel as if you've been separated completely from your faculty when Eng 1 students spend all day together in their physics labs, 1P13 lectures, and the likes while CS remains a relatively small group. My goal as a CS rep is o build connections that bridge the gap in the programs and ensure that the separation gap narrows, creating the envisioned Fireball Family united as one. My secondary objective is to provide as many opportunities as possible for CS students to network and get their foot in the door as it pertains to opportunity and co-op, as the first year co-op is a foreboding task that leads to a large amount of stress. 
My plan as a rep is such:
  -> Establish comingling opportunities advertised under CS and Eng programs/classes to 
            increase CS participation in events and clubs
  -> Organize networking events with nearby companies and guests in computing industries 
            for advice, practicing elevator pitches, and getting to know some future employers
  -> Organize study groups for CS and Eng students alike to work together and overcome 
            their classes, whether shared or not, together
  -> Convey opportunities of interest to those who may have missed out on knowledge, such 
            as providing details of research opportunities, on-school work experience, and more 
  -> Invite and organize guest lectures to expand learning beyond the scope of year 1 
            courses (Open to anyone in Eng, but geared towards CS)

     Overall, my job as a First Year Rep is to be the person to go to when you don't feel like you belong, don't know what to do next or how to move forward, and someone who brings the program into the fold of engineering! I believe that we are all at our strongest together, and together we will pull each other towards a brighter future!`,

Hosting events where first-year students from underrepresented backgrounds (especially Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) can meet senior engineering students, faculty, and alumni of similar backgrounds. These mixers could serve as safe spaces to share experiences, build networks, and create a sense of belonging. Partnering with diverse student associations on campus (like Black Student Union, Women in STEM, etc.) can strengthen the turnout and support system. I also want to increase first-year engagement in campus events, particularly Engineering-based events. I would accomplish this by creating more publicity about such events among first years. I also want to advocate for and encourage first-years to participate in Mentorship programs so they feel free to ask for help where and when needed.

    introduction: `Hello! My name is Rian Sen Majumder, and I'm in my first year of Engineering 1 at McMaster. I’m excited to run for Engineering 1 MES Liason because I believe I can foster collaboration and amplify the voices of our cohort.

Throughout my time in high school, I’ve had the privilege of being on the student council for multiple years and serving as the Grade 12 representative, where I learned to navigate the responsibilities of communicating effectively between students and the administration. This experience sharpened my ability to listen to my peers and ensure their concerns were addressed. I organized student-led events, collaborated with teachers and other representatives, and worked hard to keep everyone informed about important updates. I was also lucky enough to be involved in many community service and leadership roles throughout my life, such as volunteering and working as a fundraising executive with 5n2 Soup Kitchens among other organizations. These experiences taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, communication, and dedication to a cause.

As a first-year student with a collaborative mindset and a passion conecting our community, I am confident I can contribute to making this year rewarding for all of us!`,
    platform: `For my platform as an Engineering 1 representative, my main goals are to ensure that the voices of first-year students are consistently heard, that we feel connected to the MES community, and that our transition into university life is as smooth and engaging as possible.
One of my primary focuses will be representing the concerns of first-year students. I will ensure that feedback, ideas, and challenges are communicated directly to the faculty and the MES. This includes actively seeking out input through surveys, drop-in sessions, and informal check-ins with my classmates to ensure that I’m addressing the concerns that matter most. I’ll also regularly update everyone on how these concerns are being addressed, so people feel that they know what’s happening behind the scenes.
The MES has a ton of exciting events and opportunities, but they’re only as effective as their visibility. I plan to take a proactive approach in advertising these events by making regular class announcements, creating engaging social media posts, and encouraging the use of the MES website and MESsenger email list. I’ll also be making sure that every first-year student is aware of the benefits of joining MES committees or attending events. Whether they’re interested in competitions, professional development, or just meeting new people, I’ll make sure the resources are at their fingertips.
I want to strengthen the sense of community among first-year students. University can feel overwhelming and lonely at times, but having a solid support network of peers can make a huge difference. I plan to work on initiatives that make it easier for first-years to meet each other outside of class, such as informal meet-ups, study sessions, or small social gatherings. As the organizer for events like the annual Ratboy Soccer Tournament, I’ll work to ensure everyone who wants to participate feels welcome, regardless of skill level, and create a fun, inclusive environment.
Engineering is challenging, and as first-year students, we all want to succeed academically. I’ll work closely with course coordinators to address any common issues or areas of confusion brought up by the class. I’ll also collaborate with MES to promote academic support events like tutoring sessions and study groups tailored specifically for first-year courses. By having a clear channel of communication between students and professors, I can help ensure that the academic needs of our cohort are met.
I’m committed not just to my term as Engineering 1 representative but to setting up future representatives for success. By maintaining thorough records of student concerns and the solutions pursued, I’ll make sure future representatives can pick up where I leave off, ensuring continuity and growth in advocacy efforts.
My platform is about listening, connecting, and making sure that first-year students have all the tools they need to thrive academically, socially, and personally. I want to make our transition into university life as seamless and enriching as possible, and I’m excited to collaborate with the MES to make this happen.`,
    anythingElseFunFact: `I like reading and always have a book on hand. My favorite genre is non-fiction. I enjoy getting lost in a good book and discussing it with others. Some of my favourites include meditations by marcus aurelius, 4 hour work week tim ferriss, and millionaire fastlane by mj demarco.

I have a passion for exploring different cultures and countries. I’ve traveled to several places and love trying new foods, learning languages, and experiencing local traditions.

I also enjoy experimenting in the kitchen and trying out new recipes. I’ve even taken a few cooking courses to improve my skills. I’m particularly proud of my homemade pasta and the diverse range of dishes I’ve mastered.

As an aspiring software engineering student, I’m naturally interested in tech, but I also enjoy gaming. I’ve spent countless hours playing strategy and simulation games like rainbow six siege, rocket league, all the assassin's creed games, red dead II, and many more, which I believe helps me think critically and solve problems creatively.

I have been playing the piano since a young age. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I love attending live performances and discovering new genres.

I’ve been actively involved in community service from grade 6. Beyond my work with 5n2 Soup Kitchens, I’ve participated in various local initiatives, including organizing charity events and helping out at local shelters.

I’m a fan of basketball and enjoy playing in my free time.

I love working on DIY projects, tinkering with electronics, and building things from scratch. It’s a great way for me to unwind and apply my engineering skills in a hands-on way. And it also looks good on my resume.`,

    introduction: `Hi everyone, My name is Navia and I’m passionate about being a voice for the engineering first years. Throughout my high school years I was involved in student council and was president in my Grade 12 year. During this time, I was able to advocate for student voices to teachers and parents. I was also responsible for organizing and running events for the entire school. I would love to use my skills for the benefit of engineering first years and continue to ensure all students have a positive experience during their first year. During High School I was a part of a First Robotics team, played rugby and worked a part-time job, teaching me how to work in a team and improve my time management. I hope to leverage my background to create a supportive and welcoming environment for all first year engineering students. 
`,
    platform: `If I were voted into position I have several things that I would like to implement for this school year. Firstly, I would like to introduce more opportunities for first years to interact one-on-one with upper years through a mentorship program. This will bridge gaps between years and help first years to become more prepared for classes and the changes that come with starting university. Secondly, I want to ensure all first years are registered and are able to access study rooms in the hatch building. Thirdly, I will use the macengfirstyears instagram to promote awareness of resources provided by the MES available to first years. I will also use it to highlight any events run by the MES geared to first years. This will allow all first years to know exactly what resources are available to them to help them through their journey in McMaster engineering. Fourthly, I want to ensure I understand the wants and needs of the students. To accomplish this I will have a suggestion box in the Hatch Building where anyone would be able to leave suggestions for things that they want to see the first year council accomplish. In addition to a suggestion box, I would introduce an online survey that students could submit their suggestions at any time. Another thing I would do if I am elected, is expand the merch that is available to engineering students. I would like to introduce specific merch for the first years that includes our graduating year. The designs could be made based on submissions from the students. Where they would then be voted on by other first year students. Furthermore, I would help students who might not have a group to study with or ask questions find people. I will have a sign up form for people who want to be a part of study groups for different classes and we will help students find like minded students to study with. Overall I’m excited about the opportunity to be your Engineering 1 MES Liaison and to implement these initiatives to create a connected community to enhance the first year experience. `,

    introduction: `Hello, my name is Minsub Kim. I am from South Korea, and I came to Canada in 2021 and came to Hamilton this year. Nevertheless, I am already obsessed with Hamilton. I decided to go to MacMaster University because people around me recommended it. They talked about the international co-op program. I like travelling and experiencing diverse cultures; their stories made me apply for MacMaster. I am currently in engineering level 1. My favourite subject during my high school life was chemistry because I loved how each substance interacted with each other. The teamwork and communication skills I have learned from my co-op experience will make me a suitable representative. I learned how much of a grateful and joyful experience it is when people work together. There were many times when public facilities broke in our office. I signed off on a recommendation to my supervisor regarding replacing them. One instance was a cushioned chair, as the cushion was for the many patients we worked with. After I personally assembled this chair, the patients enjoyed the new chair after the day. My superivsing doctor was satisfied that the patient felt more comfortable, and I felt proud that my recommendation worked.
`,
    platform: `Being an Engineering 1 representative requires big responsibility and an active attitude. These are my plans for my platform. I would concentrate on two things: academic support and engineering society. During high school, the amount of concepts was limited. Most students could understand with 1 to 2 hours of studying per day.
In contrast, university is different. The class is longer, and the amount of work is bigger. Therefore, I can easily see people struggling, including me. Struggling for a few hours and solving by themselves would level up their thinking skills, but some factors require help. For example, when students face tricky questions, they try to solve them, but some need further knowledge. Then, even if you think thoroughly, the student cannot reach the answer. Therefore, I would solve it by a system called criss-cross. One thing that impressed me the most at McMaster is the stance of the professors, TAs, and students. They were all prepared to help others. I have never been rejected. Therefore, I would make a session where students can ask anything they want.
Furthermore, I would not limit the subjects. I felt annoyed that I had to go different buildings to get help from different subjects. Therefore, I sum up all of them. In addition, if it is available, I would make the additional team on Microsoft Teams to make students discuss freely. Recently, I realized some people feel more comfortable online. Therefore, this team would make the discussion more pleasant and further away. Next, I would make study sessions and speech from others for the social event. Sessions would be same as what I said, like not making the limitations in the session.
In contrast, for the speech, I will plan only for the particular dates. For example, before summer vacation starts, I would ask people in their upper years to show me the best way to spend summer break. It would be more helpful if I focused on the popularity of people, but as its suitability, I would focus more on the dates.

    introduction: `In recent years, my involvement in my local community has been characterized by my willingness to balance my time and take on leadership roles and responsibility.  Within my school last year, I led my school's robotics team grade 12, was selected to be a counsellor for Leadership Camp, served as an elected Grade 12 Representative on my school's student Council, served as a Senator on the DDSB Student Senate, and a Student Ambassador.  I was also recognized for my spirit when I was selected to be a Leadership Camp Counsellor.  My cabin won the ""gold medal"" at the end of camp because of the spirit we presented.  I attempt to bring a positive and uplifting attitude to all aspects of my life, and intend to be someone that is approachable to all first-year students.

I will be a valuable asset to the MES because I plan to continue forward with the same effort I have committed to my community in the past to making the Mac Eng1 community a positive space for all students.`,
    platform: `My favourite part about this organization is that it is the connection between faculty and engineering clubs, which makes it easier for students to communicate with faculty ""higher up"" on important issues.  My platform is based on fulfilling the needs of first-year Eng1 students, and adding to the amazing work that the MES does to provide resources to students and to ease the transition of first-years into university.

Firstly, one of the most irritating issues that I and other students notice are the small-to-medium accessory costs of our courses.  Notably, textbooks generally cost in the range of $100-$150 per course.  These textbooks are sometimes more valuable material than the lectures themselves, and many are either inaccessible in libraries, or impractical for students to access.  In addition to this, an issue that has emerged recently has been the direct ""pay-walls"" that students must cross to access essential materials for class.  For example, iClicker and Childsmath, which are used in 3/5 of first-year engineering courses, and both require fees to access.  This is not to say that the fee is insurmountable - as it's significantly smaller than textbooks, but it is a frustrating problem because it is required that  students purchase these applicaitons in order to receive a portion of their mark.  It would be beneficial if the Engineering Society either fully or partially subsidized the cost of these apps so that they could ease the stress on first year students.  Ideally, the same subsidies could be applied to textbooks, but I recognize that it could potentially cost too much, so I propose (if this is legal) that the MES website contain links to online textbooks for all core first-year courses, perhaps even including some core second-year courses provided that a large enough portion of the engineering student body must take those courses.

A second issue of my platform is a social problem.  Throughout Welcome Week and persisitng today, I struggle to get involved in both engineering and general university-wide events, simply because I don't know where/when/if they are occurring.  I feel as though the main method that people can find out what's going on it though word-of-mouth, but that fails to reach everyone, especially in short notice.  I think that with better outreach via posters and social media reminders, more socially reserved people could feel more connected to the engineering and school community.`,
    anythingElseFunFact: `I love engineering challenges (like robotics and independent projects like wood/metal/stoneworking), immersing myself in nature, and heavy metal music.

I enjoy spending quality time with friends and family, and I look for possible opportunities to get involved in my community, which `,

As outreach team leader, I would love to bring my content creation side to MES and work on making content that is funny and relatable for engineering students at mac! I believe that I'm a fun, social, and outgoing person who is approachable and isn't afraid of making a fool of themselves! I think that these traits could be beneficial as outreach team leader due to the nature of the role as it entails lots of socializing and fostering/creating relationships in order to benefit MES and reach the society's goals. I believe that my various social media experiences such as live streaming, video editing, short video production and long video productions are all unique experiences that are transferable and could greatly benefit me as the role of MES Outreach leader!`,
    platform: `I’m excited to apply for the role of Outreach Team Leader for the McMaster Engineering Society because I have a passion for increasing engagement, fostering connections, collaborating with peers and strengthening the spirit of the engineering community. My goal is to not only increase participation and engagement within our community but also to listen to student input & improve future events and initiatives. 

As an experienced media coordinator for my pickleball club, I am equipped with strong communication, Outreach and engagement skills. I have successfully promoted upcoming tournaments, teaching clinics and other developmental programs that we ran. I have used strategies to target and reach new audiences and have created content that appeals to different demographics and people. My experience with content creation such as making TikToks and Instagram reels has allowed me to understand trends and social media algorithms. Given the opportunity as Outreach leader, I plan to increase visibility and participation amongst engineering students during events and initiatives that we host.

If given the chance, a few of the changes I would implement are:

1. Diversify Outreach Channels: Although posters around campus are good, I believe that diversifying Outreach channels and focusing on our online presence, especially on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and LinkedIn will gain a lot more traction. Instagram and Tiktok are excellent platforms to take advantage of because we can engage with students and promote our events using content such as reels, polls and livestreams! LinkedIn will allow us to connect/reach out to professions and develop useful relationships that will benefit our engineering community. 
2. Building Relationships: Another goal I would work towards is increasing external partnerships. This includes increasing our alumni network, looking for sponsorships and creating joint events with local small businesses. Getting more alumni to come back and talk about their experiences within the workforce can provide students with real-life exposure and help them form connections that may be useful in the future. Doing joint events in collaboration with small businesses gives them exposure and incentivizes students to engage and participate at events. This leads me to my next point, student participation.
3. Expanding Member Involvement:  I believe that we should focus on increasing participation at our events through a variety of different ways. First off, I believe that having one-on-one conversations will allow us to personally connect with the student body, permitting more genuine and personal answers. Next is the use of quick and simple surveys such as using instagram polls or instagram story responses as it doesn’t take much time to fill out! Getting feedback from the students is a great way to adjust our future events to meet their needs, in turn increasing involvement. 

Overall, my goal as Outreach Team Leader is to increase social media presence, expand external partnerships, and boost involvement among the McMaster engineering student body. With my past experiences and passion for inclusive community engagement, I believe I'm a strong candidate for the role in helping MES succeed.`,

I'd like to be MES's first-year outreach team leader because I have a distinct interest in the promoting and marketing side of MES events. I'm outgoing, people-oriented, and eager to meet and talk with my peers to hear about their ideas and concerns about first-year engineering events and affairs. I was a critical member of one of my high school's biggest clubs (in student body), the Black Student Association. More specifically, I was part of the Management Team (a more focused subgroup of the BSA) where we developed and organized ideas and brought them back to the larger group to divvy up the workload and to put on the actual events. I'm very familiar and comfortable with working in a large team because of this background, meaning I can accurately and effectively communicate the needs of first-years and of the social media and design teams back and forth. In my opinion, I possess the ideal trait for a team leader: the ability to seamlessly weave between compromising and taking charge, and know when each is required. `,
    platform: `I'm excited to bring a fresh approach and a first-year perspective to the social media and design teams. My platform is focused on prioritizing first-year engagement in MES social media accounts and events. Through a first-year centred approach, the MES can foster community and inclusivity for new and incoming students. It is important to me that all students feel represented and included in the "definition" or "image" of an engineer, so I would also stress outreach with affiliated clubs and organizations for minorities in McMaster Engineering like: WEI, MEWD, and Black@MacEng or NSBE Mac. I’m dedicated to enriching the MES's online presence with innovative and interactive ideas and designs. Starting by implementing the attitude that MES social media and events don't just have to be for current engineering students can help with creating a stronger community, recruiting, and retention within the faculty. `,
    anythingElseFunFact: `Hiii, I'm originally from Pickering, Ontario, so I'm living on campus here at Mac. In high school, I always wanted to pursue computer science, so I took the course from grade 10 to grade 12, and I always really enjoyed it more than any of similar course, like functions. When it came time for university applications, computer science was always my first choice, I was always put off by the lack of physics in the course loads I was seeing. I'm glad now I decided to also apply to Eng 1 at McMaster (my current program) as I can finally pursue all of my interests (coding and physics). Though I'm not completely sure what I want to pursue as a career, I've recently had a new interest in the implications of modern physics in computing, specifically quantum computing. For this reason, I have an interest in software, computer, or engineering physics streams, like I said before. I'm also considering further education beyond my undergrad, like a Master's here at Mac, since I want to study the topic beyond an undergraduate level. I'm also really interested in a lot of the clubs and teams affiliated with MES, especially DeltaHacks, Start Coding, and WEI. I really like how these clubs have a focus beyond McMaster student body and want to use their resources for greater causes. I'd like to be involved with any of the aforementioned even if I don't end up as outreach team leader. `,

1. Networking opportunities

As we all know, being a part of McMaster engineering means a lot of time dedicated to studying and academics. However, in order to succeed in the work force, connections and socializing is of utmost importance. As events team leader, I would introduce events where the student body could meet people in the common engineering industries, allowing them to get an understanding of what post-grad work would look like. I would also like to introduce events where engineering students from all years can get together, implementing a “buddy system”  where first year students are paired up with upper years. 

2. Interactive Events

Despite our heavy course load, I believe that it’s important for students to have a good balance of academics and socialization! As events coordinator, I believe that we should host events that are inclusive and available to everybody! Whether that be art based events, sports events or academic events! This includes more get togethers, not only with first years but all engineering students.
